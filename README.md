# Mario Kart DS Texture Dump
## What is this?
This is a (soon to be) complete Mario Kart DS texture dump.

By the time this is finished, it will contain every texture from every course, character and kart, and map object, along with local and global maps, and cup pictures.

All textures dumped from courses, course objects, characters, and karts are in Nitro TGA format with their respective filenames.

## Why?
In the (very) old MKDS Texture dump, some of the courses' textures were missing, and it did not include character and kart textures.

Plus, it seems like a (somewhat) useful resource.

## A texture or two are missing, what should I do?
Submit an issue report with the texture I missed.
